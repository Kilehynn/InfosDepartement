#InfosDeparteme,t
A small project that I had to do for intership of my second-year of engineering at Wandercraft.
I had one main goal : create in a week an app that fetched data from a French governmental API about departments, store it in a DB, show the list of the department to the user and when he clicked on a depatment, show a bunch of infos about the latter.
